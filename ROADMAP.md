# CryptWizard : Password Manager Project

# Roadmap

[x] Project Setup

- Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes.

[x] Authentication

- Implement user registration and login functionality.
- Use hashing and salting to securely store and validate passwords.
- Implement password recovery or reset functionality.

[x] Password Generation

- Add a password generator feature to create strong, random passwords.
- Allow users to customize password settings (e.g., length, character types).


[x] Password Storage

- Create a secure mechanism for storing and retrieving passwords.
- Implement features for adding, updating, and deleting passwords.
- Include the option to categorize and label passwords (e.g., by website, application, or type of account).

[x] Encryption

- Encrypt sensitive data, such as stored passwords and user information, using a secure encryption algorithm (e.g., AES).
- Ensure that encryption keys are properly managed and protected.

[x] Backup and Recovery

- Allow users to create backups of their password database.
- Implement a recovery process in case the user loses their password manager data.

[x] Cross-Platform Compatibility

- If possible, make your password manager available on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) to reach a broader user base.

[x] Testing and Quality Assurance

- Thoroughly test your password manager to identify and fix any bugs or vulnerabilities.
- Perform security audits and penetration testing to ensure robustness.

[x] Deployment

- Package your application for distribution.
- Consider using packaging tools like PyInstaller, cx_Freeze, or creating platform-specific installers.

[x] Continuous Improvement

- Collect user feedback and consider adding new features or improving existing ones based on user needs.

[x] Database Design

- Decide on a database system (e.g., SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store user information and passwords securely.
- Design the database schema to store user credentials.

[x] User Interface Design

- Python framework tkinter for the GUI (PyQt5)
- Design the user interface for your password manager. You can use libraries like tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy for creating the GUI.
- Include features like login, registration, and a dashboard for storing and managing passwords.
